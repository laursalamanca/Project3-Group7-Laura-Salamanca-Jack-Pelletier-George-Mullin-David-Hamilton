        <p>
          Accidents are something no one really prepares for although everyone
          should as statistics show that during the course of the average
          driver’s lifetime they will be involved in 3 to 4 of them. So a little
          preventive medicine could go a long way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any accident, even a minor fender bender, can rattle the most
          even-keeled of us. Let’s talk about what to keep in mind and what to
          do at the accident scene. You may even want to print this list out and
          keep it in your glove compartment.
        </p>
        <h3>
          <b>Accident Tips</b>
        </h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Check to see if there are any physical injuries. If there are, don’t
            think twice, call 911 and call the local police.
          </li>
          <li>
            Even though you may not feel hurt, don’t take chances, get checked
            out at a local hospital. It’s for your own protection as sometimes
            the symptoms of injury aren’t obvious to anyone except a doctor.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make sure to get all the information from the other party including
            driver’s license, license plate number, vehicle registration,
            vehicle id (VIN#) and the other party’s insurance company name.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you have your phone or a camera make sure to take pictures of the
            damaged areas of both vehicles, any objects involved (such as guard
            rails, telephone poles, or buildings) and the accident scene.
            Especially skid marks.
          </li>
          <li>
            Also, take pictures of the location including street signs and other
            identifying information or landmarks if possible.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fill out a police accident report immediately, keep a copy for
            yourself and submit it to your insurance company.
          </li>
          <li>
            If there are witness try to get names and phone number and if
            possible a statement from them, preferably written or recorded on
            your cell phone, at the scene as to what they saw happen.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the police are involved ask them if anyone is going be cited.
          </li>
          <li>Report the accident to you insurance company immediately.</li>
          <li>
            If your vehicle needs to be towed, tell the towing company where you
            want your car taken to. Remember, the insurance company usually pays
            for the towing.
          </li>
          <li>Even though it’s hard, try to remain calm.</li>
          <li>
            After you get home go to your computer and google “What should I do
            after an accident in Massachusetts” and if you find something you
            didn’t take care of at the scene, don’t wait, take care of it right
            away.
          </li>
        </ol>
