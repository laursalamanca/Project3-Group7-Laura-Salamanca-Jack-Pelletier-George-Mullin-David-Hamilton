          Summer will be here soon. Sports car, classic car and hobby car
          owners, start your engines! Actually, before you do, you’ll want to
          follow some simple steps to bring your summer ride out to play after a
          long winter. Here’s a checklist of what to do — either on your own or
          at the shop — if you’ve had your vehicle stored.
        </p>
        <h3>
          <b>Top 5 Checklist for Bringing Your Car Out of Winter Storage</b>
        </h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>Inspect Battery</b>
            <img src="images/battery.png" alt="battery" style="width: 32px" />
            <p>
              The most important item to check is the condition of the car’s
              battery. I hope that you had the battery on a maintainer/tender
              during the storage period? Look at your maintainer to see that the
              battery is fully charged. If not, put it on a charger, although
              the integrity and life of the battery will likely be compromised
              if the charge has completely depleted. Bottom line, do not attempt
              to start a stored vehicle with a half drained battery. And don’t
              boost it. There’s nothing worse that trying to crank a cold engine
              for the first time in months with a weak battery. When connecting
              the battery, check the cables and terminals for
              corrosion/oxidization and clean if necessary. Some modern cars
              require the battery to remain connected at all times to maintain
              the on-board computer memory. In this case, a battery maintainer
              still needs to be used during storage.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Test Engine Oil</b>
            <img src="images/engine-oil.png" alt="oil" style="width: 32px" />
            <p>
              Pull the dipstick to see if there is adequate oil in the engine
              and add if needed. This oil is now old and should be changed at
              your earliest opportunity, even if you changed it just before
              storage. Don’t skip this step. Fresh oil is cheap insurance for
              the health of your engine.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Examine Other Fluids</b>
            <img src="images/water-drop.png" alt="fluid" style="width: 32px" />
            <p>
              Check the fluid levels for coolant, power steering, brakes and
              fuel. Did you put fuel stabilizer in the tank before storage? If
              not, add octane booster and get high-octane gas in the tank. Old
              gas will make the engine run rough so adding fuel stabilizer is an
              important precaution prior to storage.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Perform a Visual Check</b>
            <img src="images/witness.png" alt="eye" style="width: 32px" />
            <p>
              Look in the engine bay and under the car for signs of fluid leaks.
              Observe the electrical wires and hoses, looking for cracks and
              deterioration. Take a screw driver/wrench to the various clamps
              that make up the fuel system to ensure that they are tight. Look
              for signs of unwanted visitors like mice who are notorious for
              chewing electrical wires. Basically, you want to do a thorough
              visual check on the key mechanical components before you start the
              car for the first time and embark on that initial drive of the
              season.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Check Tires</b>
            <img src="images/wheel.png" alt="tire" style="width: 32px" />
            <p>
              Check tire pressure and correct as necessary to bring to the
              suggested PSI rating indicated on the sidewall. Look for cracks
              and bulges in the rubber.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />
        <h3><b>Other Items</b></h3>
        <p>
          Look at the brakes to ensure there is adequate pad and rotor material.
          Look at the suspension components and pull on the control arms and
          tie-rods to check for excessive play. Check the exhaust and remember
          to take the steel wool out of the tail pipe or whatever you use to
          prevent rodents from entering.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now that you’ve done your due-diligence to ensure that your stored
          vehicle is good to go, put the key in the ignition and fire it up.
          Expect the engine to run rough at first as it will take several
          minutes for the fuel to fully circulate to enable a smooth idle. Let
          the engine idle up to operating temperature before you hit the road.
          Take it easy in the beginning. Remember, this car hasn’t been driven
          for months so don’t push it hard on the first run.
        </p>
        <p>
          The above check list may seem excessive but it is important to ensure
          that your hobby car is ready for the season ahead. You don’t want to
          be disappointed with mechanical problems resulting from overlooking an
          important detail in preparing to bring a vehicle out of prolonged
          storage. Spring is just a few weeks away and with lots of heavy rain
          to wash the salt and crud off the roads, classic cars will be back on
          the scene. Just watch out for all the potholes – you’re hobby car will
          be less forgiving than the daily driver.
