          <p class="testimonial-quote">
            “I had pulled into a parking spot that had a chunk of ice which
            pulled off the plastic undercover of the front of my car. When I hit
            40 mph, my car sounded like a bicycle with a trading card in the
            spokes. After being told it would be a wait of at least two weeks to
            get it repaired at a Toyota collision center, I stopped at AV Repair
            on my way to work. Not only was my car put on the lift within 10
            minutes, Mr. Smetanka had the mechanic put in some screws to hold it
            in place. He explained that except for the fact the plastic was a
            bit ragged from scraping the road, it did not need any further
            repair. When I asked for the bill, he said, ‘No charge. Glad to
            help.’ I haven't had anyone be this honest and generous in a long
            time. I will definitely take my car here if it needs any repairs. I
            have also recommended AV repair to all my friends in the area.”

            “On a Thursday evening, I called AV Repair to have them look at some
            rear bumper damage to my car. Jim was able to look at it first thing
            Friday morning. When I dropped it off, he took a look at it,
            explained what he could see, then explained to me what the potential
            issues could be once they looked underneath. About an hour later he
            called back and explained the situation: cosmetic damage only. I
            pushed a little to make sure there wasn't anything that I really
            needed to take care of. He explained which layers of the bumper had
            absorbed the impact and which hadn't even been touched, setting my
            mind at ease. I would go back to AV Repair in a heartbeat. They have
            a strong customer service focus, are patient, and they're willing to
            educate people like me.”

          <p class="testimonial-quote">
            “I've been in the area almost 13yrs and have never found a garage
            that I felt I could really trust. We found this place as we were
            looking for a repair shop after our car was involved in fender
            bender and needed body work back in Dec'12/Jan'13. Jim was very
            helpful and informative and he also took time to explain a lot of
            the work that was needed. He also mentioned they do more than just
            autobody work and based on that, we decided to send our cars over
            for maintenance and other repairs. Since we started going there, we
            have been VERY pleased with the service, the quick turnaround time,
            the reasonable prices, and also with Jim's candor. If we were
            looking at a big job for a car, he asked what our intentions were to
            put into perspective whether the fix was really needed or possibly a
            nice-to-have. We ended up not having the job done, which would have
            been more than $2k, but he's earned our trust and repeated
            business.”
