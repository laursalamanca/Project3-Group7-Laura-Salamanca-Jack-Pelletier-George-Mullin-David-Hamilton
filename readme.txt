List of Improvements:

Home Page (Laura Salamanca)
- Removed the unnecessary grid of buttons at the top of the home Page
- Added a better quality photo that is smaller and doesn't take up the whole Page
- Moved the important information about the company towards the top
- Moved the reviews section to the bottom and made it look neater and more presentable by
  typing the reviews into an organized list instead of screenshots of google reviews
- Added a link to go to Google to review AV Repair Inc. if you click on the "Google" logo
- Added an image slideshow to show off the different services the company offers. This consolidates
  the images so there is not a long list of pictures taking up the whole page.
